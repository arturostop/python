# Python 3
> Course about how to use Python to handle any kind of data, generate scripts, programs, grapic interfaces with Tkinter and improve databases with SQLite 

### Before you begin

- Windows 7 or newest, GNU/Linux(Ubuntu, Debian...) or Mac OS X
- 1 GHz or faster desktop processor
- 512 MB of RAM (at minimum; more is better)

- Installing python 3
  - Download the lates version by followig the instructions for your OS at https://www.python.org/downloads/
  - In your console, run the next command to see the version installed
```
python --version
```

- Jupyter notebook
  - This is a very useful tool to use python and compile the examples in a very fast way
  - Execute pip comand to install Jupyter Notebook 
  ```
  pip install notebook
  ```
  - Once the installation is finished you can make a .bat file with a command to run the notebook
    
    - This will open the notebook by default in C:\Users\"local user"  
  ```
  jupyter notebook
  ```
  
  
    - This command will open the notebook in the .bat file directory     
  
  
  ```
  python -m notebook .
  ```

- Installing Visual Studio Code (Editor/IDE)

   - You need something in which to write your python scripts. If you already have an editor you like, you can use it. If you don't I recommend you to use the free Visual Studio code editor. You can download the installer from https://code.visualstudio.com/
    - After it is downloaded, open VSC and from the top menu bar, select View
    - From the list of options, select Extensions. A panel should appear on the left side. At the top is a search input box.
    - Type Python and the first option should be an extension by Microsoft
    - Clic the Install button on that option and wait for a message that says it's successfully installed.

### Run scripts

- You can run the python scripts that you make directly on the Visual Studio Console, or you can use the system console
  - In script directory run:

```
python hola.py
```
